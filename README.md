# image-to-ascii

A simple Python tool that converts images into ASCII art.

Give it an input image, and it will generate a text-based version using ASCII characters. This can be useful for fun terminal art, lightweight previews, or experimenting with image processing in Python.

Modify width and height/ascii_width and ascii_heigh for different results.
